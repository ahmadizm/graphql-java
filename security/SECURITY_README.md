## Submitting CVE records

Use https://vulnogram.github.io/ as a UI to write, validate, and submit CVE records.

In this Vulnogram UI, you'll be able to view a JSON preview of the CVE payload. You'll find a sample payload in this directory.

It's better to use the Vulnogram UI as it'll provide extra validation of input.

Also note, as a CNA we do not need to provide a CVSS score for CVEs. This will be done by security vendors instead.
